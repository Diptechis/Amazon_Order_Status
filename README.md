# Problem Description
To build a model which would predict the order status (Delivered to buyer or Returned to seller)
BL is a small leather products business which has recently started selling its products on Amazon. Currently, it has around 40 SKUs registered in the Indian Marketplace. Over the past few months, it has incurred some loss due to return orders. Now, BL seeks help to predict the likelihood of a new order being rejected. This would help them to take necessary actions and subsequently reduce the loss.
COLUMNS: order_no ,order_date ,buyer, ship_city ,cod,ship_state,shipping_fee,item_total,quantity,description,sku
          
	    I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KFold.
